## Description
Write a recursive C program that calculates the 'n'th Fibonacci number given an integer n >= 0.

## Requirements
- First two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1 for n = 0 and n = 1
- All other Fibonaccia numbers can be calculated as the sum of the two predecessor numbers.
- Basic anchor cases : f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1
- Recurrence relation : f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
